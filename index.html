        <h1> About Us </h1>

        <p>About Penny Memorial Foundation</p>
        
        <p>Penny Memorial Foundation (also known as PMF) is non-profit youth social impact organization founded by
        Tawanda Kanemeyer in 2018. Penny Memorial Foundation was founded to inspire, empower and unite the
        youth with the goal of having them be positive contributing members of the community. </p>
        
        <p>Additionally we look to promote the idea of kindness: helping each other regardless of any differences such as
        race, gender, colour, ethnicity, sexual orientation, creed, social class or any other characteristic. By promoting
        kindness we strive to create a culture of togetherness amongst all people across the world. Helping one
        another whenever possible, no matter how big or small. </p>

        <p>Penny Memorial Foundation strives to help achieve the following SDGs; 1 no poverty, 3 good health and well-
        eing, 4 quality education, 5 gender equality, 8 decent work and economic growth, 10 reduced inequalities, 15 life on land, and 17 partnerships for the goals.</p>
        
        <p>PMF is a registered trust organization under Deeds Registries Act of Zimbabwe</p>

        <p>PMF was formally Kunda Cares Foundation, and was re-named to Penny Memorial Foundation on July 25 2021
        after the unexpected death of the founder’s aunt. “Penny was always very supportive and a beam of
        kindeness and love, therefore it is only right to rename the foundation after her as we strive to be the same
        for the youth and our community” – Tawanda Kanemeyer</p>

        <h3> Partnerships </h3>

            <p>In October 2020 we partnered with Youth Against Cancer Zimbabwe to help fundraise to get under-privileged
            members of the community screened for breast cancer. We made 60 facemasks at a discount with the profits
            going towards getting community members screened. As a result we were able to get 120 people screened by
            the end of October.
            In November 2020 we partnered with Youth Against Aids (Y.A.A.) Club at St. John’s High School Emerald Hill to
            supply the school with school branded facemasks with part of the proceeds being donated towards purchasing
            a school honour board. This will be the first honour board since he school was open in the early 1900’s. </p>
        

         <h3>Grassroots to World Class </h3>
        
    

            <ul class="pul">     
                <li>Grassroots to World Class is a Kunda Cares program that is committed to helping grassroot athletes,
                teams, and sporting organizations in Zimbabwe by providing them with equipment, knowledge of
                proper nutrition and training (physical and mental), and funding.</li>
                <li>The goal of this program is to help develop Zimbabwean grassroot athletes, teams, and organizations
                into world-class players, able to be competitive against the best in the world.</li> 
                <li>Grassroots to World Class will be powered by sports equipment drives, corporate and personal
                donations, volunteers, and fundraisers. </li> 
            </ul>

        <h2> Partnerships</h2>
        
            <p> In February we partnered with Chitungwiza Golden Girls netball club to donate equipment to them. We have
            donated training bibs to them and plan to donate more equipment as funds allow.</p>

        <h2> Fundraising</h2>

            <p> Kunda Cares main fundraiser will be the selling of apparel (t-shirts, hats, outer wear) with proceeds being
            donated towards select causes and helping sustain the organization. These items will be sold at our office, via
            pop up shops and online. Fundraising t-shirts can be purchased through our Kunda Cares Foundation Shop
            online store at shop.spreadshirt.com/kunda-cares-foundation-shop.</p>      
        
            <p>In May 2021 we held our inaugural stroke awareness campaign and virtual walk & run for stroke awareness.
            We raised $416 USD from donations and registration fees for the walk & run. Additionally, we received
            donations of food, household items, clothes, walking assistance equipment and school stationary. Donated
            resources were used to assist stroke victims across Zimbabwe including two stroke care facilities St Giles
            Medical Rehabilitation Centre in Harare and Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo.</p>
